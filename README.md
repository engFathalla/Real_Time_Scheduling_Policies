# Real_Time_Scheduling_Policies

Feasibility-testing of real-time scheduling algorithms on the NVIDIA Jetson TK1 platform
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Multithreaded application development using NPTL (Native POSIX Thread Library) to evaluate real-time performance of the Tegra-Ubuntu operating system on the Nvidia Jetson TK1 platform.

-- Formulation of parameters for synthetic workload generation associated with each thread, and their synchronization using semaphore give and take methods.

-- Implementation of Rate Monotonic (RM), Earliest Deadline First (EDF), and Least Laxity First (LLF) scheduling algorithms, and verification of their feasibility using completion tests as well as Cheddar simulations.
